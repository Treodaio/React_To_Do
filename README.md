### There are not many projects as graceful for learning programming concepts as the To-Do List. Here's my suggestion.

Click [here](https://treodaio.github.io/React_To_Do/) to see on GitHub Pages.

- Refactor code from class to Hooks
- How to use Hooks
- Data-filtering 
- Working with date objects.
